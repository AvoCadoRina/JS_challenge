                <h1>Clover</h1>
                <p>Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, tres "three" + folium "leaf"), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume or pea family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a
                    cosmopolitan distribution with highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial,
                    or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled; see four-leaf clover), monofoil, bifoil, cinquefoil, hexafoil, septfoil, etcetera, with stipules adnate
                    to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx.[3] Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover)
                    and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).

                <h1>Hydrangea</h1>
                <p>The genus name comes from the Greek “hydros” (“water”) and “angos” (“jar” or “vessel”). It roughly translates to “water barrel”. Hydrangea symbolizes gratefulness, honest emotions and persevering love. Hydrangeas represent positive emotions
                    for the people that are close to us, including our family members, therefore they symbolize our family roots, our origin and our past. They also carry negative connotations, and can represent vanity and boastfulness.</p>

                <h1>Rose</h1>
                <p>A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can
                    be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[citation needed] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.
                    Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[citation needed] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have
                    acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[citation needed] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used
                    in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>
